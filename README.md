# RSIVQA (Remote Sensing Image Visual Question Answering)
--------------------------------------
RSIVQA is a remote sensing visual question answering data set proposed in the paper "Mutual Attention Inception Network for Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering".
The paper is currently under review of IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing.

Overview
--------------------------------------
RSIVQA data set contain is generated from existing remote sensing image classification and object detection data sets with a specially designed generation method. Details of the generation method can be found in the paper.

Currently, RSIVQA contains images from three RSI classification data sets (UCM, Sydney and AID) and two RSI object detection data sets (HRRSD and DOTA).
